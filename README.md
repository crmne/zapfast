# ZapFast

**WhatsApp, native and fast.** ZapFast is a WhatsApp client written in Rust
with [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui). It uses
[whatsapp-rust](https://github.com/oxidezap/whatsapp-rust) for the WhatsApp Web
protocol. It runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows, links to your phone as a
companion device, and has no browser engine. In our Linux test, it opened in
under a second and used about 150 MB of idle RAM, compared with 1.13 GB for
WhatsApp Web and its Chromium processes. [See the measurements](https://zapfast.rocks/benchmarks/).

ZapFast is a sibling of [Spotifast](https://spotifast.rocks),
with the same native UI for a different service.

## What it does

- **Links to your phone.** Scan a QR code or link with your phone number.
  Recent history is copied to this computer after linking and stored here.
- **Chats.** See pinned, unread, muted, and archived chats, typing indicators,
  and message status. Search chats, saved messages, and contacts.
  Pinned chats stay in pin order (most recently pinned first), regardless of
  new messages. Chat and contact name searches ignore accents, so `Angel`
  finds `Ángel`.
  Typing indicators show other participants, excluding your own linked devices.
- **Read state across devices.** Reading a chat syncs its unread badge with
  your phone and other linked devices, including when read receipts are off.
  Replies from another device clear preceding unread messages. The read-receipt
  toggle also controls voice-message played receipts; account privacy is checked
  before sending receipts in direct chats. A hidden window does not read messages.
- **Conversations.** See replies, reactions, edits, deleted messages, read
  receipts, sender names, and group pictures. Older messages load as you
  scroll up, first from the local archive and then from your phone.
  Group messages show two gray checks after every recipient has received
  them, and blue checks after every recipient has read them. The recipient
  list and individual receipts are saved locally; later membership changes
  do not change that list. If the original recipients are unknown, ZapFast
  waits for the phone's aggregate status instead of guessing from one reader.
- **WhatsApp formatting.** Bold, italic, strikethrough, code, lists, quotes,
  mentions, and link previews are supported. Links are clickable. Hebrew and
  Arabic RTL paragraphs keep logical word order by reordering font runs; this
  is not a full Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm. Emoji use the desktop's
  color emoji font, with a bundled fallback, and emoji-only messages are larger.
- **Send attachments with captions.** Paste a picture, drop files, or use the
  file picker. They stay in the composer until you send them or press Escape.
- **Mute chats** for eight hours, one week, or indefinitely. The setting also
  applies on your phone and to desktop notifications. Mute changes from your
  phone survive history arriving later, including during initial linking.
  Existing installations request one settings refresh after upgrading to
  recover previously lost mute settings and pin order, without relinking.
- **Voice messages.** Play, seek, record, reply with, and send voice messages
  in the chat. The app normalizes quiet recordings and handles OGG/Opus
  without external tools.
- **Send messages.** Press Enter to send text and Shift+Enter for a new line.
  You can swap these keys in Settings. The composer is focused when you open
  or return to a conversation; invoking search keeps focus in search, and
  Escape clears search and returns to the composer; another Escape closes the
  chat and saves your text draft. Open menus, dialogs, and unfinished actions
  are dismissed first. Type `:name` to autocomplete
  an emoji without leaving the composer, or `@` in a group to mention a member.
  Reply, react with any emoji, edit, forward, delete, and check when a message was sent,
  delivered, or read.
- **Disappearing-message timers.** Outgoing messages use the chat's known
  timer, including replies, attachments, edits, and forwards. Forwarded copies
  use the destination chat's timer. Received messages remain in the local archive
  after they expire on the phone.
  A clock badge on chat avatars shows enabled timers and follows changes from
  the phone. Changing the default timer for new chats leaves existing chats alone.
- **View attachments.** ZapFast downloads files up to 64 MB automatically or
  on click. Photos, stickers, GIFs, voice messages, audio, locations, contacts,
  polls, and link previews appear in the chat. Videos and documents open in
  their default desktop apps. Profile pictures and downloaded images support
  Windows drive paths and filenames with spaces or non-ASCII characters.
  If an attachment has expired, ZapFast asks your
  phone to upload it again.
- **Polls.** Use the checklist button beside the paperclip to create a poll with
  2–12 answers. Turn off **Allow multiple answers** for a single-choice poll.
  Click an answer in a poll to vote; click a selected answer again to remove
  it. Results and your selection are retained in the encrypted archive, including
  votes received through phone history. Visible polls automatically request earlier
  votes from your phone. If it is offline, results are labelled incomplete and the
  request retries with backoff; no refresh button or relinking is needed.
  Voting needs the original poll's key;
  if that key is missing, the message explains that voting is available on your
  phone. Creating polls in disappearing-message chats is not yet supported by
  the protocol library's poll API, so ZapFast blocks it instead of ignoring the timer.
- **Emoji, GIF, and sticker picker.** Search emoji and GIFs, use recent emoji
  and stickers, and save stickers with a right-click. Emoji autocomplete and
  picker search select their first match; use the arrow keys and Enter to
  choose it. GIF search needs a free GIPHY API key unless the build includes
  one.
- **Sticker packs.** Import a pack from a `signal.art` link or `.wastickers`
  file. Animated packs remain animated. Packs are stored as WebP files on your
  computer.
- **Consistent names.** Use names from your address book or public WhatsApp
  profile names across chats, replies, mentions, and notifications.
- **Groups.** See members, sender names, and sender pictures. Announcement
  groups are read-only for non-admins.
- **Presence.** See online, last-seen, and typing status, and send your typing
  status.
- **Idle rendering.** History-sync progress updates when data arrives. Animated
  stickers and GIFs play only while their message or picker tile is visible.
- **Sync recovery.** A conflicting app-state collection is recovered through
  whatsapp-rust, including requesting a fresh snapshot from the paired phone
  when validation fails. Private read-state updates run one at a time. Failures
  pause the whole queue with backoff from 30 seconds to 15 minutes; pending reads
  remain saved and resume automatically. New messages can still arrive.
- **Runs in the background.** Closing the window keeps ZapFast linked in the
  system tray. Reopen it from the tray or by launching it again. Quit from the
  tray or with `Ctrl+Q`, or disable this behavior in Settings.
- **Desktop notifications.** Get notifications with the chat picture when you
  are away from the open chat. Muted chats do not notify you. Windows notifications
  identify ZapFast as the sender and show chat pictures as small circular icons;
  installed and portable builds register this identity in the current user's registry.
  On Linux,
  clicking a notification opens the chat, and reading the chat here or on another
  device dismisses its outstanding notifications. On macOS, notifications use
  the installed ZapFast application's identity without an application chooser;
  unregistered development builds skip notifications if that identity is unavailable.
- **Update notices.** ZapFast checks GitHub once a day and shows a download
  link when a newer release is available. You can turn this off in Settings.
- **Themes.** Light, dark, follow the system, or a local JSON palette. Native
  Linux packages can follow Omarchy colors without restarting the app. Zoom with
  Ctrl+plus and Ctrl+minus.
- **Copy text.** Select part of a message or copy across messages in
  WhatsApp's `[time, date] Name:` format. Contact names and numbers are also
  selectable.
- **Keyboard shortcuts.** `Ctrl+K` searches, `Alt+↑/↓` switches chats and
  keeps the active chat visible in the list, `Esc` cancels the current action,
  `Ctrl+L` focuses the message input, and `Ctrl+/` lists all shortcuts (use
  Command instead of Ctrl on macOS). The × at the left of the shortcut hints
  hides the bar; restore it with **Show shortcut hints** in Settings.
- **Local storage.** Messages, contacts and sticker metadata are stored in a
  SQLCipher-encrypted archive, unlocked automatically through your OS keyring.
  Existing plaintext archives are migrated on first use. Attachments remain
  ordinary files in the cache directory, or in a custom folder configured in
  Settings. Unlinking removes this device and clears cache files while
  preserving custom folders.

## What it does not do yet

- Play ordinary videos in the app (they open in your player), or reply to
  a message with an attachment.
- Calls, status posts, communities, newsletters, and group administration.

## Installing

On macOS with Homebrew: `brew install --cask crmne/tap/zapfast`.

ZapFast was previously called FastsApp. Version 0.13.0 introduces the new
package and executable names. On Arch Linux:

```sh
yay -S zapfast-bin      # the released build, ready made
yay -S zapfast          # the release, built from source
yay -S zapfast-git      # built from the latest commit
```

Builds for every release are on the
[releases page](https://github.com/crmne/zapfast/releases):

| Platform | File |
| --- | --- |
| Linux x86_64 and arm64 | `zapfast-vX.Y.Z-<target>.tar.gz`, with the desktop file and icon in `packaging/` |
| Windows x64 and arm64 | `zapfast-vX.Y.Z-<target>-setup.exe` (no administrator rights needed), or the `.zip` |
| macOS, universal | `zapfast-vX.Y.Z-macos-universal.dmg` |

On macOS, the rounded Dock icon matches the app bundle. Native menus provide
Settings, editing, search, view controls, and window commands. The traffic
lights share the chat header, leaving more room for conversations in a normal
window. Settings is also available with `⌘,`.

The macOS release process signs the app with Developer ID, submits the DMG
to Apple's notarization service, and staples and validates its ticket before
publishing. Open the DMG and drag **ZapFast** to Applications.
When upgrading from FastsApp on macOS, quit the old app and remove its
application bundle after installing ZapFast.

Releases before 0.13.0 keep their original FastsApp filenames.

### Flatpak

Flatpak packaging lives in `packaging/flatpak/`, following Spotifast's source
manifest and release-bundle setup. Future releases will attach an x86_64
`.flatpak` bundle; install a downloaded bundle with `flatpak install --user FILE`
and run `flatpak run rocks.zapfast.ZapFast`. Flathub publication is pending;
ZapFast is not yet listed there. See [PACKAGING.md](PACKAGING.md) for local builds
and preparing a Flathub submission. File selection uses desktop portals;
the sandbox has no general access to your home directory.

### Archive encryption

The archive key is a random 256-bit secret in Secret Service on Linux, Keychain
on macOS, or Windows Credential Manager. Linux needs a working Secret Service
provider (for example GNOME Keyring or KeePassXC with Secret Service enabled).
If the keyring is locked or unavailable, unlock it and click Retry; ZapFast keeps
its archive intact and waits before connecting. It never saves a replacement
plaintext archive. Back up both the archive and its OS keyring key: copying only
`archive.db` to another computer is insufficient.

Only `archive.db` and its SQLite journal/WAL are encrypted. Device credentials in
`session.db`, downloaded media, profile pictures, saved sticker files and settings
remain ordinary files. Use full-disk encryption for those files, swap, backups and
remnants of the old plaintext archive. Migration removes the original only after
verifying its encrypted copy; deletion cannot guarantee erasure from SSDs or
snapshots. Keyring unlocking also does not protect against software running as you
while your login is unlocked.

### From source

ZapFast needs Rust, a C/C++ toolchain, CMake and Perl (for bundled OpenSSL). `rust-toolchain.toml` pins the exact version. On Linux,
it also needs GUI development packages:

```sh
# Debian and Ubuntu
sudo apt install libxkbcommon-dev libwayland-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libasound2-dev cmake perl
# Arch
sudo pacman -S libxkbcommon wayland mesa alsa-lib cmake perl
```

Then:

```sh
cargo install --path .
zapfast
```

The desktop file and icon are in `packaging/`.

`whatsapp-rust` is pinned to a Git commit because version 0.7.0 on crates.io
enables a `simd` feature that needs nightly Rust. The pinned commit builds on
stable Rust and includes the upstream fixes for missing app-state snapshots and
conflicts that make no progress. ZapFast does not reset your session to recover
a collection.

## Using it

On first start, scan the QR code from WhatsApp under **Linked devices**,
**Link a device**. To link without the camera, click **Link with phone number
instead**, enter your number with its country code, then enter the shown code
on your phone.

WhatsApp then sends your recent history. This can take a few minutes. A banner
shows the progress. New messages arrive live, and your phone does not need to
stay on the same network.

Right-click a chat or message to open its menu. Open Settings from the gear or
with `Ctrl+,`. Use the pencil to message a new number or save a contact. You
can also open a group member's contact card. Saved names sync through WhatsApp
to your phone and linked devices.

## Files

| What | Linux | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Settings | `~/.config/zapfast/settings.json` | JSON, safe to edit |
| Device keys | `~/.local/state/zapfast/session.db` | Owned by whatsapp-rust; deleting it unlinks |
| Messages | `~/.local/state/zapfast/archive.db` | SQLCipher-encrypted SQLite, unlocked by the OS keyring; raw messages retain attachment keys |
| Attachments, avatars | `~/.cache/zapfast/` | Safe to delete; attachments can be stored in a custom folder in Settings |
| Saved stickers and packs | `~/.local/state/zapfast/stickers/` | Plain WebP files; each pack is a folder |
| Log of the last run | `~/.local/state/zapfast/zapfast.log` | `--verbose` for more |

macOS and Windows use the standard platform directories selected by the
`directories` crate. On first start, ZapFast moves settings, the linked session,
message archive, saved stickers, caches, and window state from `fastsapp`
(or the earlier `fastwhatsapp`) paths. Existing ZapFast directories take
precedence and are never overwritten. Quit FastsApp before starting ZapFast;
if an older copy is still running, the new launch brings its window forward.
Your phone may keep showing the old linked-device name until you link again.

On Linux and macOS, ZapFast restricts its configuration, state, and cache
directories to the current user (`0700`), including existing installations.
Startup stops if those directories cannot be created or secured, before opening
logs or databases. Windows uses the permissions inherited from your user profile.

### Local themes

**Settings → Appearance → Theme** uses the same picker as Spotifast, with
Follow system, Light, Dark, and its Catppuccin, Catppuccin Latte, Nord, Ristretto,
and Tokyo Night palettes. Choose **Open themes folder** below the picker to add
JSON palettes beside `settings.json`. A local file with a bundled palette's name
overrides it. For example:

```json
{"base":"dark","colors":{"accent":"#89b4fa","bubble_out":"#293954"}}
```

Unspecified colors inherit the light or dark base. Spotifast palettes also work:
chat backgrounds, bubbles, and links derive from their interface colors when not
specified. Color names match `Palette`
in `src/theme.rs`; use `#RRGGBB` or `#RRGGBBAA`. The last accepted palette is cached
in settings, so a missing or damaged theme file does not reset your appearance.
Linux watches the themes folder for changes without periodic repaints. On other
platforms, use `zapfast reload-themes` after editing. The command also works while
the window is closed and never launches a stopped app.

On Omarchy, **Follow system** and **Omarchy** read the active desktop palette and
follow its changes in native, portable, and source builds, even without installed
hooks. Other desktops keep their normal light/dark system preference. Native
packages additionally register a missing per-user template and theme hook on
first launch; existing user files are preserved. Flatpak uses the desktop's
light/dark preference and does not read host theme files or install desktop hooks.

### Updating ZapFast

ZapFast checks GitHub once a day when **Check for updates** is enabled.
Click **Update** in the banner to download and verify a newer release, then
**Restart to update** when convenient. **Download updates automatically** is
optional and off by default; it downloads in the background and still waits for
you to restart. Downloads contact GitHub's API and release-asset hosts and are
checked against the release's SHA-256 checksums. The updater keeps a backup and
restores it if the updated app cannot start.

The in-app updater supports marked portable downloads, the Windows installer,
and the macOS app in Applications. Keep `zapfast-portable.txt` beside a portable
executable. AUR, DEB, RPM, Flatpak, Cargo and Homebrew installations use their
package manager. Older portable downloads without the marker need one manual
upgrade. No account or additional service is needed.

## Developing

```sh
cargo run --features demo -- --demo            # sample chats, no connection
cargo run --features demo -- --demo-page login # or settings, pair, info, light, …
cargo run --features demo -- --demo-shot shot.png --demo-page chat,light
cargo run --features demo -- --demo-tour      # Space starts/replays a 41-second tour
cargo test --all-features                      # includes a headless layout of every screen
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

To include a default GIPHY key for GIF search, set it at build time. A key in
Settings overrides it:

```sh
ZAPFAST_GIPHY_KEY=your-key cargo build --release
```

The earlier `FASTSAPP_GIPHY_KEY` build variable remains supported as a fallback.

`AGENTS.md` describes the architecture and the rules for changes.

### Recording a demo

The `demo` feature uses offline sample chats in a fresh temporary directory.
It does not open your linked account, read your message archive, connect to
WhatsApp, or register a tray icon. You can run it alongside your regular app.

```sh
cargo build --locked --features demo
./target/debug/zapfast --demo-tour --demo-size 1280x800
```

The **ZapFast Demo** window waits for **Space**. The 41-second tour starts with
search, switches chats with keyboard shortcuts, scrolls, right-clicks a message
and selects Reply, types quickly, completes emoji and mentions, searches the GIF
picker and sends a still sticker, opens group information and the shortcut list,
and changes themes through Settings. It uses the normal mouse and keyboard handlers;
a local responder handles outgoing messages with no WhatsApp connection.
The GIF-search thumbnails and still stickers are rendered from the bundled
Noto emoji font; demo GIF search uses these local fixtures. The tour makes no
sound and holds its final frame. Space rebuilds the sample and replays.
For an automatic start, add `--demo-tour-delay 5000` (milliseconds).
Use `--demo` instead of `--demo-tour` to explore the sample chats yourself.
For deterministic theme screenshots, `--demo-page settings,omarchy` and
`--demo-page settings,omarchy-light` preview following dark and light Omarchy
palettes without changing the desktop theme.

On Omarchy, run `omarchy screenrecord`, select the demo window, then press Space
in ZapFast. Recording has no audio unless you explicitly enable desktop or
microphone audio. Stop with `omarchy screenrecord --stop-recording` after the
tour finishes. The default capture records a fixed rectangle, so keep the demo
window visible and stationary until recording stops.

To annotate the video with a visible pointer, click rings, and outlined shortcut
labels, add `--demo-tour-events tour.json` when launching the tour. After
recording, run:

```sh
python3 scripts/render-demo.py recording.mp4 tour.json launch.mp4 --start 0.8
```

Set `--start` to the recording time (in seconds) when you pressed Space. The
export trims the setup footage, adds a caption band below the app, and produces
a silent H.264 MP4. It requires `ffmpeg` with libass support and `ffprobe`.
These annotations are added during video export, not drawn by the app. The
trace contains only pointer coordinates and shortcut labels, not typed text.

ZapFast is an unofficial client and is not affiliated with WhatsApp or
Meta. Using an unofficial client may be against WhatsApp's terms of service
and could get an account suspended. Use it at your own risk.

## Packaging maintenance

Release packaging uses the [native-packages](https://rubygems.org/gems/native-packages) gem. macOS release builds automatically sign and notarize when the Apple CI credentials are configured. `native-packages.yaml` declares packages and downstream repositories; native recipes and installation assets live in `packaging/`; see [PACKAGING.md](PACKAGING.md) for local commands and CI behavior.
